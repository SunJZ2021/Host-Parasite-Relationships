Multiple infection is naturally common, as humans and animals tend to be infected by different strains of the same parasite species. This work focuses on modelling the population dynamics of co-infection, which is one of the theoretical frameworks of multiple infection. Furthermore, A trade-off is considered in addition to the original model. Then different scenarios in equilibrium, effects of model parameters and several extensions are analysed. The results may help improve understanding of parasite dynamics in multiple infections and gain basic mathematical approach to study the evolution of parasite virulence.
