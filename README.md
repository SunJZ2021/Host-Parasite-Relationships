Naturally, it is common that humans and animals get infected by different strains of the same parasite species, known as multiple infection. Based on van Baalen & Sabelis's model, by focusing on the population dynamics of coinfection, which is one of the theoretical frameworks of multiple infection, and considering a trade-off condition, different scenarios in equilibrium and effects of model parameters are analysed in this work. The results may help improve understanding of parasite dynamics in multiple infections and gain basic mathematical approach to study the evolution of parasite virulence.
